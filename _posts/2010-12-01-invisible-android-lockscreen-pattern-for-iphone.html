Here's a handy trick I use to add more security to my iPhone lockscreen. Android phones can be unlocked by drawing a pattern on the lockscreen, and if you jailbreak your iPhone you can install an extension to add this ability. It's called AndroidLock XT and you can install it from the xSellize Repo:

Setting a pattern:

I set my opacity to 0 so the pattern is completely invisible on my lockscreen.

Anyone who picks it up will have no idea what to do, and unlocking accidentally is unlikely. Also, the slide to unlock is gone, freeing up space for the actual background.

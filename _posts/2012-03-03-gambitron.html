For the past few months I've been working with a friend to bring about an iPhone game. It's coming together nicely and I thought I'd share our group's launch image with you. I thought of this shape lying awake at night and thought it'd be neat.

I thought of "Gambitron" as a combination of "Gambit", "Game", "bit" and "tron", all which have some relevance to what we're doing. Our site is at <a href="http://gambitron.com" target="_blank">gambitron.com</a> and we'll be adding content shortly.

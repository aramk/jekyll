I haven't made a post here for a long time, mainly because I've been far too busy, not because I had nothing to post. Thing is, I'll be posting a lot of code, but taking a look at some of the syntax highlighters out there for WP made me wonder why I shouldn't just make my one of my own, rather than use a plugin someone else wrote to use someone else's code.

Long story short, I've spent the past several months doing a far bit of development. I started out playing with iOS development and found that pretty neat, but turned towards web development with PHP because I found it more practical, and the results of my tiresome labour came sooner.

I am currently developing my own syntax highlighter, called Crayon, which will integrate with Wordpress far better than others. Sadly my development is frequently interrupted by Uni as I spiral into a heap of dismal homework.

Rest assured though I have my eye set on releasing Crayon in the near future, and endless waves of updates will surely ensue thereafter. Hope it works out...

Check my twitter for updates as I finish development:Â <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/crayonsyntax">http://twitter.com/#!/crayonsyntax</a>
